Title: Methods for Adaptive Shrinkage, using Empirical Bayes
Description: The R package 'ashr' implements an Empirical Bayes approach for
    large-scale hypothesis testing and false discovery rate (FDR) estimation based
    on the methods proposed in M. Stephens, 2016, "False discovery rates: a new
    deal", <DOI:10.1093/biostatistics/kxw041>. These methods can be applied whenever
    two sets of summary statistics---estimated effects and standard errors---are
    available, just as 'qvalue' can be applied to previously computed p-values.
    Two main interfaces are provided: ash(), which is more user-friendly; and
    ash.workhorse(), which has more options and is geared toward advanced users. The
    ash() and ash.workhorse() also provides a flexible modeling interface that can
    accomodate a variety of likelihoods (e.g., normal, Poisson) and mixture priors
    (e.g., uniform, normal).
